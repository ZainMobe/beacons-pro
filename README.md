# 🔦 Beacons Pro - iOS iBeacon Scanner & Broadcaster

Beacons Pro is a lightweight iOS app that turns your iPhone into both an **iBeacon broadcaster** and a **beacon scanner**. It allows you to scan nearby iBeacons using a specified UUID and also broadcast your own beacon signal using CoreLocation and CoreBluetooth.
